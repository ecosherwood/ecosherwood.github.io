On the way to Bladensburg, Maryland to finally take a tour of the Anacostia Watershed, our bus halted next to a murky stream. Haunting, disturbed murmurs flowed through the crowded bus as we stared through our windows at the littered asphalt and water below. Yet, our shock quickly turned to anger as we caught a glimpse of the factories directly adjacent to the discolored stream. 

"How could anyone have let this happen?" said Julianna Gross, a junior on our team. "Why didn't some regulation stop industry from developing directly right next to the stream?" 

Regulations may exist. But that clearly does not always guarantee their acceptance by the community, explained our adviser Laura Dinerman as our bus began pulling away from the cloudy waters. Environmental health and science become overlooked when the need for industry and business become more important to a community- an obvious theme with predictable conseuqneces that can devastate the hearts of environmentalists. 

With a passion to prevent similar circumstances in other streams, our group arrived at the Bladensburg Waterfront Park and filed off the bus and onto a relatively uninhabitated area of the ecosystem. Several soda cans littered the tall grass and an area of eroded soil led into a shallower strech of the Anacostia. Gazing down at the waters, our group listened as Tony Thomas, our Smithsonian coordinator, explained how the community once used this area of the river for swimming and fishing.

Now, the area remained silent and still- without human or animal presence. Due to countless years of pollutant dumping, this portion of the river had become utterly lifeless. Granted, the turbidity (particulates featured in the water that cause murkiness) had decreased substantially, Thomas recalled. Nearly clear water, yet a complete lack of biodiversity. The toxicity of the water remained too high for most major species to survive. 

After analyzing the area, our group traveled further down the river and arrived at the dock where we would depart for the next part of our tour. The gentle hum of the engine picked up as we fastened our life vests and watched waves spin around the pontoon boat. Despite noticing obvious litter and turbidity, Thomas explained that conditions in the river have improved significantly in recent years. While the Anacostia previously earned a grade of 0 in terms of submerged vegetation, the river received a score of 37 for this same criteria in the 2017 State of the Anacostia Report Card. More submerged vegetation supports increased photosynthesis and oxygen levels in water, which ameliorates the health of the river and supports aquatic life.

Thomas continually emphasized that the river faces a challenging- yet entirely possible- recovery. The 2017 Anacostia River Report Card also featured improvements from previous years in the areas of fecal bacteria, water clarity, trash, toxics and overall comittment to the river's improval from the community. 

Stepping onto the dock, we sat in awe of the running river before us. Despite enduring intense pollution in the latter half of the 20th century, a trend of increased health still remains possible. Humbled and honored that we get to partake in analyzing the river from its very beginning as a stream in the Northwest Branch, our group members stood in appreciation for the river's resilience.
