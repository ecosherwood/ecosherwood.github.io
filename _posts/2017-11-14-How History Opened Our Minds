Beneath a canopy of autumn leaves and remnants of a dewy, foggy morning, our group members huddled together and settled on a plan of spontaneity for the next several hours. Our decision to roll with the flow created one of our most eventful, meaningful days of discovery yet, as we began to understand more than just the science behind our study site- but the history and humanity as well. 

If anyone had asked our group if we had expected to engage in a tour of a section of the underground railroad on the morning that we had scheduled a tour of the Anacostia river, our group members would have dismissed these questions instantly. Yet, a walk that we had expected to be a  brief, science-related tour of our study site before boarding the bus to the Anacostia quickly became a historical tour.

After brief moments of debate, we deicded to continue with the tour for the entire duration of the hike through our study site- despite any delays to our previously established plans. Led by an employee of Woodlawn Manor, a local cultural museum depicting Quaker and Underground Railroad History, the tour educated us on how slaves utilized the environment to their advantage.

In the silence of sunshine sifting through the trees, inspiration stirred in our group members' minds as our guide explained how hollow trees (featured above) would serve as spaces of safety and rest for weary, escaped slaves. To have the privilege of our study site also serving as a cultural representation of freedom from the oppression of slavery immediately caused empowerment to spark in our group.

Our inspiration continued to soar as we became informed that a tree (featured above) that we frequently pass while hiking to the study site represented a sign of freedom to escaped slaves. We had passed the tree countless times before- yet could now view the image with a newfound sense of awe and respect. 

Upon our return to the bus, our group members enjoyed a sense of piqued curiosity. If one morning could have given us an entirely new perspective on our study site, we felt enthusiasm to discover the other part of the Anacostia and whatever other information- scientific or historic- that we would encounter. 

The very nature that we overlooked in exchange for focusing on the environmental damage of our study site could no longer remain unnoticed. In the future, we hope to find ways to connect the science aspect of our work with the history behind our Northwest Branch of the Anacstia study site and build a larger community awareness of the site for both reasons.
