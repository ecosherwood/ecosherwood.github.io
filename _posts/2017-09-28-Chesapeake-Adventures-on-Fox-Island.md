 After months of studying the health of the Sandy Spring and our neck of the Anacostia and Chesapeake Bay watershed, some of our group members traveled to Fox Island from June 19th to June 21st. The Smithsonian sponsored our trip with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF), allowing us to travel to an old hunting lodge on the island and learn firsthand about the health of the bay, particularly in comparison to our Northwest Branch of the Anacostia. Finally, after our engaging school year came to a close, our long-awaited trip began as a group of six Ecosherwood members boarded the bus, and headed toward Crisfield, Maryland. Once we arrived at Crisfield, we boarded the CBF’s boat and our “#ecosherwoodtakesfoxisland” adventure began.

Upon our arrival at Fox Island, we discussed our goals for the trip and reached the agreement that a vital aspect of our trip would be to have fun while collecting fascinating data about the health of the bay. First, we ventured to Smith Island, specifically Tylerton, to speak with natives about the rising sea level, the crabbing crisis, and life on the island. Despite the news frenzy related to potential flooding and loss of industry, many of the island natives remained unconcerned while discussing safety threats to their beloved home.

However, the next day as we traveled to Tangier Island, locals portrayed a completely different story. One woman was immensely distressed about the imminent danger posed by rising sea on the island, and spent a lot of time speaking with us about the town and their efforts to raise imperative awareness and funds for a sea wall.

In order to explore water quality, we obtained various data sets as well. We set up wildcams in order to capture a glimpse of the wildlife surrounding us, performed water quality testing, and collected samples to observe biodiversity in the bay while keeping a biodiversity log throughout the entire duration of our trip. 

Our group also learned about the different aspects of water quality that affect life including nitrates, phosphates, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity and depth. Then, using probes, nitrate testing kits, and a secchi disk, we began to test the water quality in various areas in the surrounding water. This knowledge became extremely useful to us in August, as we recently set up and placed probes in our northwest branch of the Anacostia, giving us an informative background to the knowledge provided to us by Stroud Water Systems and EnviroDIY.

A special thank you to the Smithsonian for giving us the gift of this trip, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation for providing us with extraordinary information during our stay and aiding us in developing our research away from our study site. Hopefully, another trip to an island in the Chesapeake will occur in the future, to build upon the research collected during our stay at Fox Island.
