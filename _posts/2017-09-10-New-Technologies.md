In the midst of anticipating the start of our junior year of high school, our group members reunited with one another at the Sandy Spring Museum on August 28th and 29th to kick off our bustling year by adding some technological advancements to our research. 

Both mornings began with concise, explanatory presentations developed by Stroud Water Systems on the behavior of streams, and the importance of the analyzing conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) of our study site. As our group seeks to analyze how human impacts effect biodiversity, we learned how these stream factors become influenced by dumping and pollutants. 

In order to analyze our stream using more than just visual observations, we would need to rely on sensors that can record numerical data, such as the exact temperature of the stream or the conductivity measured in ppm. Our new technology would provide us with all of that- and the ability to feed our general curiosity with the introduction of some coding.

Meet the Mayfly logger. A petite, condensed circuitry system designed to retrieve a wide scope of data from streams just like ours, with minimal environmental impacts and technological effort required from researchers and scientists. With the ability to access data such as the stream’s CTD, this ingenious invention serves as eyes at the stream when our group members cannot be there.

EnviroDIY, a company that seeks to ensure that the desire to become environmentally active can be attainable, regardless of prior experience in non-scientific professions, provided us with our logger and an introduction to the science behind the system. When first presented with the green board, our group members experienced a brief introduction to circuitry that served as both informational and invaluable to retrieving the data from our logger. 

As we began to experiment with how different code altered the beeps and flashing lights of the logger, we all remained amazed. Our exposure to much grander technology on a daily basis proved no match for several meager red flashes on a board and modest temperature sensors. “It was cool to learn what made the sensors work and it was beneficial to understand everything that went into the technological side rather than solely the environmental side,” said Claire Moran, a junior on our team. 

To understand exactly how our logger would function provided not only a glimpse into another scientific realm, but a deeper appreciation for the fact that our technology is accessible to us. As a motivated group, we have consistently sought to ensure that our project remains our own, and that we remain involved in understanding every step of the way. If that involves a brief introduction to computer science, we felt more than ready.

The next day, we secured the mayfly loggers into their proper boxes, specifically designed as waterproof in the event that they should encounter submersion or flooding. As we returned to our study site after the entire summer to implant the pole holding our box into the ground, we spent the afternoon getting our boots in the water. We further examined our site and used the information previously presented to us to find stellar examples of where to place our logger and sensors. After finalizing our study site and completing the relatively simple installation, we felt incredible to finally begin utilizing a machine that had the capability to seek data vital to our research. 

Currently, we can access data from our mayfly logger using a small SD card that conveniently fits into any computer. With this new innovation, we are ready to tackle the year ahead with new data to support our research!
