After diverse, lively summers, our group members reunited and excitingly met one another at the Sandy Spring Museum on August 28th and 29th to kick off our bustling year by adding some technological advancements to our research. Our mornings began with concise, explanatory presentations developed by Stroud Water Systems on the behavior of streams, and the importance of the analysis of conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) while examining the data alterations in our northwest branch.  Not only that, we had the opportunity to understand exactly how this technology would work, beginning with our curious experimentation with the coding behind it all to ultimately placing it into the soil.

Meet the Mayfly logger. A petite, condensed circuitry system designed to retrieve a wide scope of data from streams just like ours, with minimal environmental impacts and technological effort required from researchers and scientists. With the ability to access data such as the stream’s CTD, this ingenious invention serves as eyes at the stream while we cannot be there.

EnviroDIY, a company that seeks to ensure that the desire to become environmentally active can be attainable, regardless of prior experience in non-scientific professions, provided us with our logger and an introduction to the science behind the system. When first presented with the green board, our group members experienced a brief introduction to circuitry that served as both informational and invaluable to retrieving the data from our logger. As we began to experiment with how different code altered the beeps and flashing lights of the logger, we all remained amazed. Our exposure to much grander technology on a daily basis proved no match for several meager red flashes on a board and modest temperature sensors. “It was cool to learn what made the sensors work and it was beneficial to understand everything that went into the technological side rather than solely the environmental side,” remarked Claire Moran, a junior on our team. To understand exactly how our logger would function provided not only a glimpse into another scientific realm, but a deeper appreciation for the fact that our technology is accessible to us. As a motivated group, we have consistently sought to ensure that our project remains our own, and that we remain curious in understanding every step of the way. If that involves a brief introduction to computer science, we were certainly more than ready. 

The next day, we secured mayfly loggers into their proper boxes, specifically designed as waterproof in the event that they should encounter submersion in water. As we returned to our study site after the entire summer to implant the pole holding our box into the ground, we spent the afternoon getting our boots in the water, as we further examined our site and used the information previously presented to us to find stellar examples of where to place our logger and sensors. From there, it solely involved installation, and we would finally be utilizing a machine that had the capability of seeking data vital to our research, 24 hours a day. 

Currently, we can access data from our mayfly logger using a small SD card that conveniently fits into any computer. From there, we have access to an invaluable set of data, that will undoubtedly take our research to a new degree of excellence, with an ease unseen before in our specific environmental research. With this new innovation, we are ready to tackle the year ahead, and cannot wait to continue sharing our story with you!
