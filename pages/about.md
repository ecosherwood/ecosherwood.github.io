Hello, and welcome to Ecosherwood! Initiated in early 2017 as an exclsuive subset of the larger environmental group at Sherwood High School in Sandy Spring, MD, our group of nine curious and driven young women joined together under our advisor, Laura Dinerman, in order to analyze a portion of the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River.

The infamously polluted Anacostia River flows into the Potomac River, reaching the Chesapeake Bay and ultimately depositing into the Atlantic Ocean. Naturally, the degraded state of the river causes major concern, as these waterways possess a tremendous impact on one another: the sickness of one will likely create symptoms in another. 

In order to begin investigating the health of the Anacostia, we decided to study the river's beginnings as a stream located roughly one mile from our high school. After hiking and arriving at the study site for the first time, we observed a lack of biodiversity in the area and began wondering how human impacts created these effects. Rather than offering immediate answers to our questions, Mrs. Dinerman insisted that we perform research and answer them ourselves. As our group spent the next several months frequently visiting the study site, collecting data on various organisms, and asking questions that only sparked more intrigue, we ultimately decided to present our initial findings at the 2017 Smithsonian Ecological Research Center symposium.

During the symposium, our group spent the afternoon in D.C. presenting future plans to implement newer technologies into our research, in addition to our original discoveries. Shortly after the June presentation date, we traveled to Fox Island, an island in the Chesapeake neighboring nearby Tangier and Smith islands. This blog will follow our journey subsequent to these events, our findings, and our implementation of newer advancements to analyze a rather forgotten stream in our small town. However, one small stream can set off a chain reaction in the grand scheme of our watershed, and we certainly do not intend on letting that impact be a negative one.

We sincerely hope that you stick around to enjoy and witness our thoughts and research develop from the next generation of scientists and curious-thinkers, in a world where environmental science grows undeniably more urgent every single day.
