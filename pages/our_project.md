This is the data collected from our site, from September 9th, 2017 to October 12th, 2017. Typically, these graphs display more recent water depth, temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen at our study site.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to provide the latest data due to an error in translating our spreadsheet into multiple graphs. As soon as these graphs are available, this page will be updated.
